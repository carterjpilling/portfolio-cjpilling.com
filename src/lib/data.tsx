enriched our decision-making process.

    testimonial: `I truly can't say enough great things about working with CJ. When I started at Verb, CJ and I were peers, we worked closely together during that time while I was managing projects and running scrum ceremonies with the engineering teams. From day 1 CJ both understood what was necessary from a technical perspective to successfully deliver what was expected - but further than that he took the time to understand the larger team and company-wide initiatives to ensure as he found technical solutions, they were truly solving the problem at hand. 
  <br/> <br/>
When I was moved to manage the engineering teams, CJ was one of the engineers I knew I could go to when tasked with more technical planning and resource allocation. His willingness to raise his hand and ask the question everyone else was silently thinking, his ability to complete tasks on time without fail, and the culture add he was to the team to get others sharing their thoughts / feelings / assumptions / preferences all set him apart as a leader on the engineering team. 
  <br/> <br/>
I would absolutely work with CJ again if given the opportunity!`,

    personName: "Stefano Martinengo",

    title: "Colleague - Hussle Technology",
    testimonial: `I had the privilege of working with CJ for 2 years recently. In that time he showed several attributes
  that I feel any company would find as valuable assets.
  <br/> <br/>
The first being work ethic. CJ shortly after starting out was put on a project that was complex and
required a pretty skilled mind. CJ proved to be an asset on that project despite constant changes that
were happening within that project. On that project, CJ bounced from working on a team, to being
the sole and lead developer on the project. <br/> <br/>
The second being his receptiveness to feedback as well as to giving feedback. CJ always took any
feedback and criticism with a cool head and receptive spirit. `,
